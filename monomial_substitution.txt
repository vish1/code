(from CSI Programming contest)

You are given a monomial of the form 4*x^2 + 3*x + 10. You are also told that the variable x itself is a placeholder for another monomial of the form x = 2*t^2 + 3*t. You have to write a program which, given the original equation in terms of x, and, the equation for x in terms of t, evaluates the resultant equation in terms of t.

Note: The index of the resultant monomial will never exceed 50. There will not be any negative power terms.

Input Specs
1.    First line has an integer n denoting the number of terms in the following line.
2.    The next line gives the monomial in terms of x and is given as follows:
       The whole monomial is given in terms of n coefficient and power pairs
       e.g. 4*x^2 + 3*x + 10 is given as 4 2 3 1 10 0 
       where the first number in each pair denotes the coefficient and the other
       number denotes the power.
3.    Next line contains an integer m denoting the number of terms in the following line
4.    The next line gives the monomial which represents x in terms of another monomial in another variable say t.
       e.g. x = t^2 + 2*t is given as 1 2 2 1

Output Specs
        The resultant monomial in terms of coefficient power pairs as mentioned above.
        For e.g. The resultant monomial after substituting the value of t in the equation for x results in the monomial 
        4*t^4 + 16*t^3 + 19*t^2 + 6*t + 10 which is written as 
4 4 16 3 19 2 6 1 10 0
